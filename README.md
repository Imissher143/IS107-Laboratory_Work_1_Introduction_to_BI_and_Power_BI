## LABORATORY QUESTIONS 

### Part A – Technical Questions

1. **What are the five columns in the dataset?**  
   -  Date, Product, Category, Region, and Sales are the five columns in the dataset.

2. **What data type is assigned to the “Sales” column?**  
   -  Decimal Number

3. **Which Power BI view allows you to see raw data?**  
   -  Table Data, as it allows us to see raw data in Power BI.

4. **What chart type is best for showing trends over time?**  
   -  Line Chart, because it clearly displays changes in values overtime.

5. **What aggregation is automatically applied to Sales?**  
   -  By default, Power BI applies the Sum aggregation to numeric fields like Sales.

### Part B – Analytical Questions

6. **Which region has the highest total sales?**  
   -  The West Region has the highest Total Sales with 55,851 total sum of sales.

7. **Which category has the lowest performance?**  
   -  Office Supplies has the lowest performing category, accounting for only 19.99%(44K) of Total sales.

8. **Are sales increasing, decreasing, or stable?**  
   -  Sales are significantly decreasing as it shows adownward trend from 2024 to 2025.

9. **If you were a manager, which region would you prioritize?**  
   -  I’ll Prioritize the North region for intervention, as it is the only territory significantly underperforming compared to the others.
     
10. **Provide one actionable recommendation based on the data.**  
    -  To investigate the year over year crash, perform a root cause analysis to determine if the steep sales decline stems from market shifts, internal operational failures, or incomplete 2025 reporting.

## ENHANCEMENT SECTION - Advanced Exploration 

### Task 1: Add a Card Visualization 
<img width="352" height="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67000b94-f0e5-406a-9d62-b5de20796097" />

### Task 2: Add Slicer 
<img width="354" height="272" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/338e5c16-3fe1-4807-8e6c-8a965352e634" />

<span style="font-size:25px; font-weight:bold;">Question:</span>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What happens to other visuals when you click a region?</strong> All other visuals update to show data only for the selected region, helping focus on regional performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Why is filtering important in BI?</strong> Filtering allows you to analyze specific data subsets, making insights faster and more accurate.</li>
</ul>

### Task 3: Sort Sales 
<img width="593" height="293" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e93444a6-fb99-49d2-ae98-483cbacda7f1" />

<span style="font-size:25px; font-weight:bold;">Question:</span>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Does sorting improve readability?</strong>  Yes, sorting makes it easier to compare values at a glance.</li>
  <li><strong>Why?</strong> It organizes the data from highest to lowest (or vice versa), allowing users to quickly identify top and bottom performing regions.</li>
</ul>

### Task 4: Identify Outliers 

<span style="font-size:25px; font-weight:bold;">Question:</span>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Which region is significantly higher or lower?</strong>  The North region is on the lower end. While the West, East, and South regions are all performing consistently near the 60K mark.</li>
  <li><strong>What might explain that difference?</strong> The North’s lower performance likely stems from a smaller customer base, stronger local rivals, or fewer company resources being assigned to that territory.</li>
